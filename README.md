# Taxonomy-scripts-ZMUT
Taxonomy scripts used at the Zoological Museum of the University of Turku (Finland). These are used to process taxonomical data, and thus speed up the process of writing a taxonomical article.

## Licence in a nutshell
Use any way you want, but please attribute.

## Contents include:

#### Morphological distances
R scripts used to calculate how morphologically similar different specimens are. Can be used to group specimens into species, or to visualise differences between species when making an identification key.

#### taxatest.csv
Test data. These are body indexes of Afrotropical Rhyssinae (from [Rousse & Van Noort 2014](http://forum.europeanjournaloftaxonomy.eu/index.php/ejt/article/view/213)).

#### R visualise morphological differences 170108.txt
Test script. This takes the data in taxatest.csv and tries to visualise it by plotting the 12 species into two dimensions. The further apart the species are, the more different they are in appearance.
